# CVYLHACK

Cyvl Physical AI Hackathon. "Build the Physical Future." Cyvl HQ, Somerville, MA. June 13, 2026. $12k in prizes ($8k / $3k / $1k).

Build a startup, not a demo, on top of Cyvl infrastructure data (LiDAR, digital twin, CV-detected assets), optionally paired with public Somerville/Boston data. Use one or two sponsor tools (NVIDIA, Autodesk, Ask Boston) in a way that genuinely fits the idea. Judges score the startup, not just the code.

## Rules that matter

- Real Cyvl data only. Fake data scores a 0 on the data criterion (25% of the total).
- Not a "Google Maps clone" — that is named as a 0 on technical.
- Use one or two sponsor tools, woven in, not bolted on. More is not better.
- Bring a working demo AND a business case. 5 min pitch + 2 min Q&A.
- Don't reframe an existing solution as novel. Search first.
- API key is private. Do not commit it.
